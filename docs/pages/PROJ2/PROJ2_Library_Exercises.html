              'Horrifyingly absurd': how did millennial comedy get so surreal?

          </p>

          <p>
            This article discusses the rise of surreal and dark humor among
            millennials, attributing it to the chaotic and ever-changing nature
            of the world and the internet. It cites many examples of this type
            of humor from various TV shows, movies, and comedians. I feel that
            this will be very useful in my project since it explores some of the
            shows that I was interested in analyzing, and also where the
            internet blends with other media which previously existed.

              How ‘Channel 5’ Is Changing Journalism, One YouTube Post at a Time
            </a>
          </p>

          <p>
            This article discusses Andrew Callaghan, the host of Channel 5. Born
            on the internet (Youtube), the channel serves both comedy and
            serious journalism. The crew of the channel have adopted a “chaos
            compilation” style of editing with a focus on genuity and absurdity.
            This article is useful to my discussion as it offers a case study of
            what type of information outlets arise from the internet.

            This article explores a right-wing subculture of Youtube and how
            subcultures similar to this interact. It discusses the different
            social media platforms that people use to engage in these
            subcultures and also the historical context of such subcultures. I
            feel that this article can help me get a general idea of what
            subcultures exist on the internet and the internet’s impact on their
            growths or formations.

              Technologising pedagogy: The internet, nihilism and phenomenology

          </p>

          <p>
            This Journal talks about how the internet has transformed how
            information is dealt with in society. Essentially, it gives access
            to information at a massive scale, which can be used as a means for
            mass education. However, it also poses complex issues revolving
            around such new information being readily available and easily
            publishable. This relates directly to my theme of how the internet
            has changed the way we consume information and the problems that
            come with it.

            This article defines nihilism and how it fits in the context
            historically and presently. It introduces the concepts of passive
            nihilism (where one accepts defeat and settles for the status quo)
            and active nihilism (where one actively questions the normative
            standards and destructs them productively to align with their
            individualism). In the past, religion and consumerism have been the
            main driver for passive nihilism, but now, technology is becoming
            the new driver. This article helps define nihilism and it shows how
            the internet might fit into the current world. It shows how the
            internet might be contributing to misinformation and how the
            internet interacts with social norms.

            This book covers many topics related to the internet and its
            potential influences on society. One particular section of the book
            is titled “nihilism on the information highway : anonymity vs.
            commitment in the present age.” I feel that this book can help me
            find more information on how anonymity might influence how people
            act on the internet, and how this affects the information available
            on the internet (and thus how people interact with this
            information).
