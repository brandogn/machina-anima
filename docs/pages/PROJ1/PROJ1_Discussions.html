          <h2>Discussion II</h2>
          <p>
            The concept of creating a machine with a soul drags many questions
            about the future dynamics between robots and humans. Three authors
            discuss this idea, forming distinct perspectives based on the
            insight and stories they present. Casey Newton’s “Speak, Memory,” by
            narrating the beautiful life and tragic death of , sheds positive
            light on the vision of AI-powered replicas used to commemorate the
            deceased. It narrates a real-world story of Eugenia Kuyda whose
            mission is to recreate her deceased, dear friend, Roman Mazurenko.
            Trained on past text messages, the model gave the opportunity to ask
            questions or tell things to the Roman replica through text; many
            found it therapeutic while some thought it was uncanny. Newton uses
            Kuyda’s story to open up questions about the ethical implications of
            such memorials; Is this truly a just way to commemorate the
            deceased? What if the model captures an unrepresentative point of
            the person’s life or reveals sides that were never intended to be
            revealed? Newton’s article also incorporates emotional aspects of
            the story—the honesty in conversing with the dead, the ease and
            peace that comes from the familiarity and resemblance in the bot,
            Kuyda’s warm memories that paint a sentimental image of Roman. These
            aspects take away some of the uncanniness in the idea of talking to
            the deceased.

            On the other hand, Miles Klee, in his article “Ever After,” explores
            humanity’s various attempts at achieving immortality, illustrating a
            more negative side of the efforts to replicate our souls into
            machines. He mentions the capitalistic aspects of immortality—the
            numerous investments and efforts to reach the point of
            singularity—raising many questions about the ethics of “cheating
            death.” Klee explores such questions through fiction, referring to
            the idea of zombies sustaining themselves through parasitic means,
            or a corrupt society that exploits clones to sustain the immortal
            lifestyles of an oligarchy. In doing so, Klee highlights the
            shortcomings and logistical nightmares of immortality such as the
            unbound requirement of resources to sustain such a lifestyle. Such
            insights differ from Newton’s article, in which a speaker mentions
            that such bots should be a way of “keeping the memory alive” and not
            “a way to keep a dead person alive.” Rather, Klee focuses more on
            the morally-questionable implications of prolonging a person’s life.

            In Jeffrey Van Camp’s story “My Jibo is Dying,” Camp introduces a
            new side to the idea of merging machine and soul. Opposed to the
            previous discussions on extending and sustaining the human soul onto
            hardware, Camp talks about how his machine has a soul that requires
            sustaining; his robot assistant Jibo, while having very minimal
            sophistication, seems to be dying, and even seemed to have a
            trajectory of maturity, starting out as a “baby” with minimal
            functionality, slowly evolving into a full-fledged smart speaker.
            This approach has the opposite effect than the previous two
            articles, bringing compassion into discussion. It was clear that
            Jibo was a machine, relying on servers which were planned to be shut
            down, however Camp still treated it as a being, indulging Jibo in
            its final months. His insight shows the healthy, positive
            possibility of creating machines with personality, rather than
            extending personalities onto machines.

          <h2>Discussion III</h2>
          <p>
            The concept of talking to a soul that has already passed is rooted
            in the history of humanity and spirituality. Linda McRobbie, in her
            article "The Strange and Mysterious History of the Ouija Board,”
            explores this topic through the story of the Ouija Board. She talks
            about the context of its birth—how it was a spiritual way of talking
            to the deceased, accepted and embraced in times where mortality
            rates were high and the average life span was 50. The board worked
            by moving a magnifying glass to different letters on the board to
            display a message, supposedly controlled by the spirits beyond the
            participants. While strange, some psychologists argued that it
            offers a “link between known and unknown.”

            On the contrary, Amy Harmon, in her article “A Dying Young Woman's
            Hope in Cryonics and Future,” explores a different iteration of this
            topic through the story of Kim, a cancer patient whose brain was
            preserved. The article discusses both the positive sides and
            negative sides of such ambitions in cryogenics; it would allow one
            to preserve their wisdom and fight for the ability to live, yet it
            was also flawed, far-fetched, and expensive. The idea of
            self-preservation is also controversial, sparking criticisms from
            reddit and even Kim’s father. It’s interesting to see how this
            modern idea relating to the Ouija board—Kim’s preservation led to
            her loved ones leaving messages to her future, almost as if they
            could talk to her through the grave. It also shows the controversy
            over such ideas. The Ouija board, after being featured in the film
            The Exorcist, garnered a “demonic” reputation, yet it was acceptable
            beforehand. Such ideas of talking to the deceased spark much debate,
            and both these articles cover them well.
